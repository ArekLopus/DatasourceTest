-Copy H2Database jar to         glassfish-4.1/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/ext/h2.jar

-Works with IDE, not working standalone


-By default Eclipse puts META-INF/persistence.xml in src/main/java
-Move META-INF/persistence.xml from 
	src/main/java
to
	src/main/resources
After mvn clean package it ends up in 	your.war\WEB-INF\classes\META-INF\persistence.xml and works fine
